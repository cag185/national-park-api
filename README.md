This app is an Express.js lightweight API to service my National Park Front End app. 

it uses Express.js with javascript
Prisma as the ORM
mySQL as the database
npm was the package manager of choice 
the project has been dockerized using docker-compose so building up the box should be as simple as:
1. docker install
2. docker-compose up

   The API is deployed on Render as a hosting service and using tiDBCloud for hosting the mySQL db
